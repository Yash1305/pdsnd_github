I have just graduated in 2020,I have done my B-Tech Degree in Mechanical Engineering and i also love to play with data to manipulate and analyze it.
As i am not sure about job in data analyst as i started learning for first time in udacity so that's why i mentioned production engineering also as i have done my 6 month internship in mahindra & mahindra (car manufacture).
